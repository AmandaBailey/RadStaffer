As part of the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Capstone, this project uses statistical methods and machine learning techniques to predict radiologist staffing needs at a telerad company.

## What's telerad?
A patient receives care at a clinic, hospital, out-patient facility, or emergency department and has an X-Ray, CT scan, MRI or similar procedure. These procedures can be scheduled events that occur during normal Monday-Friday business hours (e.g., routine mammograms, cancer follow-up scans) or they can result from emergencies at any time of the day or night (e.g., car accidents, heart attacks, broken bones). Whether routine or emergency, the images are transmitted to a telerad company who employs radiologists to read & interpret the images and report back to healthcare providers. This is telerad!

## Want more?
Python code and all results are being held in a private repo due to Non-disclosure Agreements with the client. But please feel to reach out to me to talk more generally about how Data Science can improve your organization: agbailey123@gmail.com
